        <h2>A Note for You</h2>
        <p>Assalamualaikum, Happy Birthday ! damn it is very tough to write something for you(in a good way ofcourse)
             but i am gonna speak the truth and what my heart says. 
             yeah sure we don't know what the future holds for us and i am kinda scared to know what is there for us in that time but 
             i am not gonna let that fear stop me from telling you how much you mean to me.
             not gonna be cliché around say flirty things but damn seeing you forsure brings out smiles around
             and having you around  definitely changes the environment in the room , you know all nice-nice 
            I definitely know that whatever happens in the future who ever comes in your life that guy is gonna be one lucky guy 
            just few more months now and who knows when we see eachother but if not remember me i am a easy to forget
            kinda person but you can try 
            </p>
            <p>
                i am gonna miss you forsure but it is what it is gotta live with it but i promise when i feel like i am 
               worthy enough for you and if it is planned by the almighty i can try again hoping it all falls according to the plan
                till that time gonna be thinking of you and smiling at the same time and always praying for you
                please do not think of me as a creepy guy i really don't know what to write 

                moments such as bunking whole day and getting caught at the end of the day , those lunches at the canteen ,
                those silly jokes , those moments are which i am gonna cherish forever 
                and if something does not go according to the plan these are the moments i am gonna live with forever 
                i never thought that one friendship will get so important to me and you'll always be my  favourite memory 
                sorry if i spoke something stupid and illogical i am not perfect but i will always try for you 
                again A very Happy Birthday ma'am you deserve the whole world 
                may allah bless you forever may everything you wish for comes to you at ease , may your dreams come true and 
                may you always be safe . "mere saare khushiyaan tumare aur tumare saare dhuk mere"
            </p>
<p>YOURS FRIENDLY, AMJAD</p>
